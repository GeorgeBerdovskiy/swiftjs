# SwiftUI JS
Simple JavaScript framework built to replicate SwiftUI syntax for user interface development.

## Future Goals
- Recreate as many commonly used SwiftUI views as possible
- Add basic reactivity controls
- Match the SwiftUI syntax as closely as possible using Babel

## Contributions
I'm totally open to contributions, especially since this is my first JavaScript framework! Feel free reach out if you're interested in working on swiftui-js.
